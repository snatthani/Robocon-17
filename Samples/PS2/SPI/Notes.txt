1. Enable SPI after setting all the bits(i.e. Master mode, data order mode, etc). 
	i.e 	DDRB|=(1<<MOSI)|(1<<SCK)|(1<<SS);	//Set Mosi clock and attention as output
		SPCR|=(1<<DORD);			//Byte is transmitted LSB first
		SPCR|=(1<<MSTR);			//Master mode
		SPCR|=(1<<CPOL);			//Clock is high initially
		SPCR|=(1<<CPHA);	
		SPCR|=(1<<SPR0);
		SPCR|=(1<<SPE);				//Enable SPI at last
		
2. Set SS pin of both master and slave to input. Connect SS pin of master to VCC and ss pin of slave to gnd
